I remeber this paper where the authors investigated a method to sequence DNA from baboon fecal samples. 
Interestingly, the authors inserted Donald Trump's face in the ðŸ’© they used in their method diagram, clearly referencing 
the kind of person he is. Unfortunately, the editors at Nature requested the removal of this, although evidence of this 
happening remains on social media, as seen in [this blog](https://merenlab.org/2018/12/17/face-on-a-turd/) where they 
discuss in more detail the implications of doing this.
