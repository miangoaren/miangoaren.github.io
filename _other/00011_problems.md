Wherever you see a field of biology that seems well-studied and with clear topics, itâ€™s actually not the case.

Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

- In microbial ecology, thereâ€™s an ongoing battle over how and when to define species, what a strain is, how to measure community diversity, how to assess metabolism, etc.  
- In evolution, there are 1001 different evolutionary models, and every time you make a phylogeny, someone wonâ€™t like it because you didnâ€™t choose THE model they would have used.  
- In protein science, it seems like we all know what we mean when we talk about folds and domains, but in reality, itâ€™s not clear when something is one or the other, which is why everyone has their own definition and structural similarity metric.  
- In virology, there are those who say viruses are a form of life, and those who say nope, as well as the debate over the possibility of creating a virus taxonomy.

And so, every field has its controversies and apparent definitions, which arenâ€™t really definitions at allâ€”theyâ€™re just the ones that have been the most successful in the public eye, until another scheme comes.
