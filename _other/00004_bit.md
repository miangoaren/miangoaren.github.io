Do you want a PhD in quantum computing without having to deal with math and circuit programming?

Well, you can achieve it by playing "The QuBit Game" developed by the [Google Quantum AI team](https://quantumai.google/education/thequbitgame)

Here is my PhD certificate :) (and a short [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/miangoar/status/1516098332153851924) for more details about this awesome game)

Now that i have a PhD i can understand everything about quantum computing. Not every day you read about the possibility of quantum entanglement between two qubits and a tardigrade in cryptobiosis üßê This preprint is awesome! It has Quantum biology, quantum computing, harmonic oscillators, and a gentle treatment of the tardigrade involved in the circuit creation. Definitely one of the best trash that I've read.

(Disclaimer: Let it be clear that this is a joke paper. But it has the potential for an Ig Nobel)

Although the quantum tardigrade thing was a joke, in reality, their biology, and specifically the proteins of these tiny animals have great potential for future biotechnological developments, for example, as strategies against cellular damage from radiation or desiccation. Here's a nice and recent review on this:
