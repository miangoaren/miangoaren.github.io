[According to this data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G0FmJhkOME_sv66hWmhnZS5qR2KMTY7nzkxksv46bfk/edit?gid=491268892#gid=491268892), 
getting a PhD does have a significant impact on the salary you can earn in biotechnology jobs (mainly in Boston). 
But in in Mexico, the pay is about ~15-20k USD annually ... F :(

According to data from the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness (IMCO), people who studied Biochemistry/Biophysics represent 
0.7% of the total professionals in the country and have a monthly salary of ~20,000 MXN (33k with a postgraduate degree) ðŸ¤”. 
You can search data for any other profession here, and they even provide information about gender wage inequality. 
This work is really cool, [take a look](https://imco.org.mx/comparacarreras/).

According to IMCO, ~50% of university students are concentrated in just 10 fields ðŸ˜¬. Ironically, although law is the 
most popular field of study, Mexico remains corrupt. I get the impression that law isnâ€™t often chosen out of 
conviction/vocation but because itâ€™s seen as a field with more job opportunities.
