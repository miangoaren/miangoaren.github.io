This paper is really hard to summarize, but I believe it is worth sharing.

This team in China managed to synthesize the complete "enantiomeric" form of the Pfu polymerase and then used it to encrypt digital information in the form of a paragraph written by Louis Pasteur where he proposed that this was possible. And not only that, since life is practically made up of L isomers, this enantiomeric form stores the information for much longer, even surviving treatments with proteases or being in water from a source for over a year. So, at least in its early stages, this new polymerase could serve as an encryption lock because decoding L or D chains is not the same, or as a mechanism to make the digital information stored in DNA chains less volatile and preserved for longer times and in a more faithful manner to the original info.
