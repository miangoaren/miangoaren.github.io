Remember, love yourselve as much as "Captain Gravity" Alejandro Gallardo loves himself; that engineer from UNAM who proposed 
"repulsive gravity" in his undergraduate thesis, claiming that his work involves modifying the law of gravity and would make 
him the first Nobel Prize winner in Physics from UNAM, Mexico, and LATAM. #Respect
