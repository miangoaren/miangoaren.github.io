Although it is an analytical artifact, I find beautiful the parallelisms that emerge when using an evolutionary perspective to understand physical, biological and cultural systems.

Physical systems seem to follow physical laws, and because of that we know that eventually the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide and form a "Milkomeda" in millions of years. But in the case of biological and cultural systems, we still cannot make those predictions, sometimes we can (and work is being done on it), but usually not (especially over long periods of time) because these systems depend on a particular context (biological, environmental, ecological, socioeconomic, etc.). And that's why life is "matter with history." Although Â¿when does chemical evolution become biological? and so on ðŸ¤”

Here is a very nice article that was passed on to me about this:

As weÃ±Ã± as a series of 3 seminars:
