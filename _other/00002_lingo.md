I just learned a very interesting fact:

The word "querer" (an spanish expression of desire for something or someone) and "query" originate from the Latin root "Quaerere", that means a search. While in Germanic languages the word evolved in a technical and almost specific context of political professions, in Romance languages like Spanish, the word evolved in a context of common use among people.

In Germanic languages "quaerere" became "query," still meaning a search. But in Romance languages like Spanish, "quaerere" became "querer". Who knows if it really happened in this way, but at least it's a nice story.

It's even more beautiful to see how words are subject to phenomena similar to those of biological evolution. Both are systems of information, but one is biological and the other is cultural.
