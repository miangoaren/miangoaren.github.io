Google Recently Launched NotebookLM: An AI That Summarizes Text/Audio/Code/URLs to Help You Study. One of the most interesting features is that it can create a ~10-minute podcast (currently only in English). Here's an example based on the AlphaFold2 article:

- It correctly identifies the innovations of AF2.
- It concludes with the implications of AF2 for biology.
