Recently in Spain the MareNostrum 5 began operations. MareNostrum is the new AI-specialized supercomputer that European 
scientists will use to train their models. Plus, it's really beautiful because it's literally a supercomputer hosted 
inside a church... maybe this is how the religion of Roko's Basilisk is born ðŸ¤”

Over $200 million dollars was invested to have this beast, and with it, many advances in AI will be made. 
If you're into computing, it's very exciting to learn how such powerful machines work. 
MareNostrum 5 is now ranked 8th among [the world's most powerful supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500#TOP_500), 
with Frontier from the U.S. being number one.

They also took a detailed photographic record, and you can

And hereâ€™s a video of how [MareNostrum 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nctTZplQY-o&ab_channel=NateGentile) used to be.
