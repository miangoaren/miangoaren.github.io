Many of the most famous Artificial Intelligences (AI) have been created by companies that do not release their code as their business model. In response to this, whenever a new AI is released, the open-source community takes a few months to release their own versions of the code, on which tons of apps are built.

When GPT-3 came out, Bloom and OPT followed suit. When Dall-e was released, Stable Difussion came out a few months later. There was speculation about whether AlphaFold2 would be open-source or not, and the rumor is that the release of RoseTTaFold motivated DeepMind to release its code.

Now we're all impressed with ChatGPT; however, training an AI like this requires supercomputers and huge databases. As expected, the community has organized to create these databases, and everyone in the world can participate in creating an open-source ChatGPT. To find out how to participate, Carlos Santana from the DotCSV channel prepared this video explaining all the details. Surprisingly, since he published his video, the Spanish-speaking community has surpassed the English-speaking community in the amount of data created for training
