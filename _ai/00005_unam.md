For those interested in bioinformatics and programming,

Microsoft has developed an artificial intelligence called GitHub Copilot that writes code in various programming languages given a text string. You can create a simple DataFrame with random data or create a function/class that does web scraping and returns the analyzed data.

Recently, Copilot was launched as a product, but developers of famous repositories and verified students on GitHub can use it for free. At UNAM (and other universities), we have access to this program, and you can enable your student package by following this [link](https://github.blog/2022-06-21-github-copilot-is-generally-available-to-all-developers/)
 If you want to know more details about what this AI (GitHub Copilot) is and how powerful it really is, I highly recommend this [video](https://youtu.be/vN7tk0ufLTM) (and the channel in general).

I hope it helps us a lot. If you have any questions related to this, feel free to write me a private message. There is no other AI that compares to it; it is like the AlphaFold2 of writing code. But the one that is most similar in its capabilities is this other one, but there you have to do the work of installing and configuring it, etc. There are several models at different scales, but the most powerful one is called
