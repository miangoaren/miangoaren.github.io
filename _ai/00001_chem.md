One can train an artificial intelligence to find therapeutic molecules for human diseases, but the same reasoning can be used for evil. To demonstrate this, this team reversed the original purpose of their AI and retrained it (with the molecules in green) to generate lethal compounds. The AI generated 40,000 lethal molecules (molecules in red) that appear to be synthesizable in the real world, and among them, the neurotoxic agent VX emerged, a molecule designed around the 1950s that is considered a weapon of mass destruction by the UN because it kills you very quickly in low doses and does not evaporate. It's also the one that was used to assassinate Kim Jong-un's half-brother when he was trying to leave North Korea

In fact, the VX compound appears in a movie called "The Rock"
