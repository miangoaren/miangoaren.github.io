Yesterday, Boston Dynamics Retired Its Iconic Robot, Atlas. They even made a farewell video:

At the same time, they introduced the new Atlas, which has shifted from being hydraulic to electric. No details have been released yet, but it probably also has better sensors, along with the "Eye of Sauron" that they added as a head:

Weâ€™ll have to wait and see if this new version can also dance to "Bebecita Bebe Lean."

But overall, these robots are such good dancers that they can pull off any song!
