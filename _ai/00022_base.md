Mathematical functions allow us to model the behavior of many things. Everything can be described in terms of functions, but 
to do so, we need to know how many variables to include and how they behave. In other words, creating good functions is not 
easy, it requires a lot of research and creativity.  

Now that we have vast amounts of data, neural networks are widely used because they can learn a wide variety of patterns from 
the data. In this interaction, the ‚ÄúUniversal Approximation Theorem‚Äù assures us that a sufficiently complex neural network 
can approximate any type of function.  

How do we make a neural network more complex? One way is by increasing the number of neurons, which allows it to learn more 
complicated patterns. For example, if we use 20 neurons to model a parabola function, the result won‚Äôt be very accurate. 
But if we increase it to 50 neurons, the network can now approximate the parabola much more precisely.  

The parabola is a simple function, but neural networks have been used to approximate much more complex functions. 
For instance, they have been used to approximate the Schr√∂dinger equation and model molecules with up to 30 electrons, 
when in its classical form, modeling just one electron is already quite complicated. Another example is predicting 
‚Äúcanonical events‚Äù that occur in our lives: birth, marriage, death, etc. By breaking life down into a sequence of events, 
neural networks can learn functions that, in a very general way, ‚Äúpredict our future‚Äù. Even chaotic systems, which are 
among the most difficult to model due to the sensitivity of their variables, can be modeled to a certain extent with neural 
networks.  

Now, whether everything can really be described by functions (which obviously is not the case), how good these functions are,
the quality of the data the neural networks are learning from, and a myriad of other questions are other debates.
