GPT-3.5 is the AI with which ChatGPT was launched a year ago. Currently, ChatGPT runs on a much better AI called GPT-4, however, many prefer version 3.5 for its cost/performance ratio. But the truth is that it has been very difficult to surpass both AIs ... until now.

Last week, Mixtral-8Ã—7B was launched, an AI that surpasses GPT-3.5. And the best part is that Mixtral can be downloaded and used for free by everyone. Mixtral is not an open-source AI, as it requires its code, training data, the AI itself, and an appropriate license to be released. In this case, the commercial rights belong to Mistral AI (the company behind Mixtral), but they decided to make their AI available for everyone to use and build upon.

Releasing Mixtral in this way is very smart, as it's like throwing a piece of bread to some seagulls. Except in this case, the seagulls are all the developers who will create and research many things (for free) to optimize Mixtral. Although using it is not cheap, as it requires a lot of memory and not everyone has a computer like that.

Mixtral has excited the community much more than the launch of Gemini, Google's AI that is on par with GPT-4. And while Gemini is great, Google has done a poor job presenting it as it lied about its capabilities, overshadowing what is relevant about Gemini.
