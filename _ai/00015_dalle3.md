A year ago, I was very excited when DALL-E 2 was released as the first AI that could create good images from text. Now, OpenAI announced a few weeks ago that DALL-E 3 is already available and will be integrated into ChatGPT+, which has been enabled to see, listen, and speak by integrating other AIs.

It's curious how DALL-E 3 didn't excite me as much as DALL-E 2, as there are already several AIs of this type. This new version understands the text you want to draw better, handles long text strings better, improves in quality, and you can integrate text into the images.

DALL-E 3 can be used for free in Bing Chat (from Microsoft) or by paying the $20 for ChatGPT+.

Here are some examples of when I got excited about DALL-E 2:
1. [When Dalle2 was released](https://miangoar.github.io/ai/00002_dalle)
2. [My experience with Dalle2](https://miangoar.github.io/ai/00004_mydalle)


And here are my results using DALL-E 3:

You can also use a tool like this to remove the background of the image and get a transparent version that is easy to handle.

Also, if you want to improve the quality of the image, you can vectorize it with #AI using
* [vectorizer-AI](https://vectorizer.ai)

In this example, I took the virus from the cartoon of the Asgard archa from the previous examples. Because this virus is small in the image, the quality is poor.
