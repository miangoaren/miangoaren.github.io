I am pleased to inform you that the article describing the first cultivated Asgardian archaeon, *Promethearchaeum syntrophicum*, has been officially published.

When you discover a new species, especially entirely new groups, as is the case here, you have to provide a detailed description and submit it for review by many committees to validate your proposal. [Hereâ€™s a summary of the process explained by me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyLF03w8lRE&t=3293s).

With the publication of this report, another step in the validation process is completed. Once finalized, the entire group of Asgardian archaea would be renamed *Promethearchaeota*, as one of the rules states that "the largest group in the taxonomic hierarchy must be named according to the first cultivated member of that group."

Thereâ€™s a fun fact you can use to impress your crush, youâ€™re welcome ðŸ˜‰.
