I just found out that Tom Cavalier-Smith passed away a couple of days ago at the age of 82. He was one of the most prolific and creative evolutionary biologists. He researched many topics, from the biodiversity of protists to the emergence of eukaryotes, symbiosis, and the origin of life in general. Over time, many of his taxonomic proposals were used as references until more detailed ones came along.

One of his latest works is this one, where he criticizes contemporary methods that are so massive and computational.

Even Antonio Lazcano commented a bit on his work and way of handling information in his series of symbiosis seminars in honor of Lynn Margulis.

I became familiar with his work in my 'Protists and Algae' classes in college, and how frustrating it was to have to learn so many names in his taxonomic classifications. Later on, the topic of taxonomy and the tree of life would become one of my favorite subjects.

I think it's a fitting tribute to share part of his work.
May he rest in peace
