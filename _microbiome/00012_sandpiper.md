Want to know where your favorite bacterium/archaea lives but have no idea how to find out? üßê

Sandpiper is a database that has analyzed ~250,000 metagenomes and taxonomically classified each of its DNA reads. This allows us to know in how many metagenomes our bug has been detected, in which environments, what its geographic distribution is, etc. Just search for the taxon you want based on the taxonomy of the Genome Taxonomy Database.

For example, here are the data for the archaea of the phylum Asgardarchaeota (p__Asgardarchaeota). Of the ~9,500 metagenomes where Asgardian archaea were detected, these seem to be the most common environments to find them.
