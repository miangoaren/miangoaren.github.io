Sometimes I think I went overload with having 66 figures in my master thesis, but then I remember [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413117306745) that put 27 panels into a single figure and I feel better.

Or this [phylogeny](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0588-1) with 19 rings, schemes, and shadings.
