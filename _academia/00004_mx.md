Mexico invests a very tiny budget in science, despite the fact that the law (article 119) establishes that at least 1% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) must be invested. Comparing Mexico (MEX) with other countries such as Israel (ISR), the United States of AMerica (USA) and Spain (ESP) this is quite evident. But this can get even worse.

A few days ago an initiative to modify the Science and Technology Law was published, which will be discussed in February 2023. I am not an expert in legislation, so I usually review profiles (on Twitter) specialized in this such as Brenda Balderrama ( @BValderramaB), David Romero (@DavidRomeroC60), Javier Flores (@javerosf) or RedProcienciaMx (@RedProcienciaMx) to be updated in this topic; and everything I've read seems to be quite worrying.

For example, hearing this is quite encouraging if you want to have a career in science in Mexico üòê ... Which bet is more likely? Stay or go?

Quote at minute 02:03:53: 
- "If the law (general law of science and technology) is proposed in the terms proposed by Conacyt, we're in trouble, colleagues. Tn trouble us and the next two generations of researchers. [...] What happens now [...] will affect our students and the students of our students, because there will be no modification in the next 20 or 30 years."

It seems prudent to follow up on this initiative by those of us interested in this world. The Mexican scientific apparatus is already very precarious and with many vices. For example, there are divided opinions regarding whether we should keep the
[SNI system](https://elpresentedelpasado.com/2020/06/22/acabemos-con-el-sni/) 


And venturing into (bio)technological innovations is equally difficult because the state does not make it easy at all (especially in matters of bureaucracy and security).

We have to be informed to make good decisions. Anyway, F.

Furthermore, according to [this report](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/royal_society_content/policy/publications/2010/4294970126.pdf), the probability of ending up in the academia for scientists in the UK (using data from before 2010) is just 3.5%. I don't know how much it is in Mexico.

So when you see someone getting hired at the academy, we are seeing a true unicorn and we can make a wish üò¨

In addition to the fact that each one have a particular context and will provide [more or less privileges](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science/stories/dr-flavio-azevedo) that makes easier to get a job in the academy.
