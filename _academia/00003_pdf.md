Someone shared with me this tool that is awesome for translating PDFs into 109 languages. 
* <https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/>

Google Translate does not do so well compared to this one, however, it is expected to fail when the texts and images are not vectorized. This tool would have helped me a lot in college where, I confess, I translated my papers and pasted the text into word :( 

I hope it helps someone.
