For a protein to carry out its function, it must be "flexible," not too much to prevent folding nor too little to be a stone. In the animation [(from the Ribosome Studio channel)](https://www.youtube.com/@Ribosomestudio) we see the flexibility of each amino acid in a protein, and the set of possible positions of all amino acids (and their associated energy states) is called conformational entropy.
