Today, a [note](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-isomorphic-alphafold-3-ai-model) and the scientific article for [AlphaFold3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w) were published, but they haven't released the code and only provide a web server with 10 jobs per day. So here’s my biggest contribution to science so far, a brief series of memes inspired by AlphaFold3:

We love David Baker's lab 🩷

Who would have thought that DeepMind would apply some ["prompt filters"](https://golgi.sandbox.google.com/about) to the input sequences in such a way that analyzing viral sequences is not allowed?

They're fast! Now we need $1 million for training:  
["It could cost upwards of US$1 million in cloud-computing resources to train AlphaFold3"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01555-x)

Everything is temporary :(

I'm just a marginally stable guy 🔥

It's incredible how almost all the biological/biochemical/geometric priors encoded in the loss functions of AlphaFold2 were discarded in AlphaFold3.

...tomorrow will be another day 😮‍💨
