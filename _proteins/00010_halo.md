Today on "Biggest Lies of the Universe":

"In the series 'Halo,' there is an episode where they sequenced the genome of the Master Chief and identified a histone with a mutation encoded on chromosome 23 that only he has.

The thing is, if one looks at the Y or X chromosome in the [ new completely sequenced human genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_009914755.4) , there is no histone with about 8 alpha helices like in the series according to the models of [AlphaFold2](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). So, I can conclude that either:

1. the human genome is not that of the Master Chief ðŸ˜• or 
2. there is no histone with those domains, and they just randomly put in a structure in the series."
