One can wake up any day and find out that there are now 600 million new protein structures predicted using artificial intelligence. Of these, ~225 million are predicted with high confidence, and about 12% have no record with any other known structure. All thanks to the use of ~2000 GPUs running for 2 weeks. Quite casual.
