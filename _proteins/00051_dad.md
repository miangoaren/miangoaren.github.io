It's interesting how an enzyme can make you want to be a dad*. A species of rodents synthesizes an enzyme (the one in the image)
in their adrenal glands that produces a hormone that eventually stimulates the male to engage in parental care, such as 
taking their offspring to the nest and grooming them.

Disclaimer: obviously, the matter is much more complex in humans.
