Since the release of AlphaFold2, a tsunami of artificial intelligence in biology has been unleashed. Many people are behind this, but some of the most prominent are:  
- David Baker (director of the Institute of Protein Design)  
- Demis Hassabis (CEO of Google DeepMind)  
- John Jumper (director of the AlphaFold2 project).  

For making AlphaFold2 and its derivatives a reality, these three have received numerous awards*, and I (and many others) bet that they will soon receive the first Nobel Prize directly related to work done with artificial intelligence (i.e., AlphaFold2/RoseTTaFold).  

Disclaimer: David is already a legend in the world of protein design; AI is just the cherry on top of the cake. On the other hand, Demis Hassabis is one of the people I admire most intellectually.

Personally, I feel a great admiration for David Baker for all that he has contributed to science. And now I feel at peace.

And even the proteins are celebrating this great award!
