Do you want to impress someone who loves proteins? Tell them that your love will last as long as the structure of proteins 
remains conserved ðŸ”¥

Just like these fusexins (proteins involved in cell fusion, such as gametes), whose structure is conserved across various 
species of eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and even viruses. This means theyâ€™ve been around for billions of years.
