AFAIK, the largest known protein complex in the Protein DataBank was a flagellar motor, composed of around 175 assembled proteins. However, a photosynthetic complex from an alga has just been published, consisting of as few as 894 assembled proteins ðŸ¤¯ ... I can only imagine the suffering of the PhDs and postdocs who created that monster.

Upon further investigation, I realized that the flagellum was not actually the largest complex, as there even exists a prestigious club of protein complexes with >1M atoms in the PDB.
