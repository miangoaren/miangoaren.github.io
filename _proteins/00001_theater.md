One day during a structural biology class, I came across this beautiful article.

Gunnar is a biophysicist who delved into the world of membrane protein structure and thus wrote "A Day in the Life of Dr K. ...". However, this is no ordinary article, as instead of being written as usual, Gunnar decided to write it as a beautiful play divided into six acts of modern tragedy.

Lysozyme is an enzyme with a strong historical significance in the world of structural biology, as it was the first enzyme to be crystallized to understand its 3D structure back in the 1960s. Lysozyme not only supports us when we are sad and cry but is also the source of our actors' unease, and it's up to you to see what role it plays in the story. The article is a general overview of membrane proteins and their importance. Here is my favorite part of Dr. K's speech to his medical students:

"K. (brought back to reality with a crash):
I guess time is up. And I'm happy to say that this was my final lecture this semester. Hope you all fail."

That's all for my report
