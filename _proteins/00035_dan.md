Today is Monday, a day to remember the work of one of the "proteinologists" from whom I have learned the most about protein biology. Dan Tawfik.

Dan studied various evolutionary mechanisms that operate on proteins, and more specifically, on enzymes. For example, in his lab, they studied a concept known as "conformational entropy." This concept refers to how certain amino acids are important because they establish more or less physicochemical interactions that allow their folding to be flexible enough to perform catalysis.

In his lab, they also studied the evolution of proteins, from early polymers to those versions of the first enzymes that had phosphate-binding regions (like that of ATP) and eventually led to functional diversification.

Dan was also an enthusiast of mountaineering. However, on May 4, 2021, the proteinology community learned that he passed away during a climb. Rest in peace..
