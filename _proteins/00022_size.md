What are the largest and smallest proteins? Well, who knows 🤷. But the ones I come across are:

* Titin: a human protein related to muscles, which can have up to ~35,000 amino acids and assembles from smaller subunits (domains), measuring as much as a bacterium

* Crambin: a protein in the seeds of a plant (Crambe abyssinica) related to broccoli, which has 48 amino acids and its function is not known for certain, but it's pretty cool.

In case you're talking with your crush, there's an interesting fact for you. Cheers.
