I often checked how many times people have accessed to read the AlphaFold2 article, and I'm glad to see that it has reached 1,000,000 accesses according to [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2) ðŸ¥³

As far as I can tell, it is the most famous scientific article in terms of this metric, and it has achieved this in less than 2 years. Undoubtedly, AlphaFold2 represents a before and after for protein science.
