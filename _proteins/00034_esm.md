It's interesting to see how an AI is folding a protein, although it has nothing to do with the biophysics of the folding process. Or does it? ðŸ¤” Here's an example (colorized by pLDDT) of how ESMFold is folding the Top7 protein, which was the first protein de novo designed by computer. Here are some examples.

If you want to make your own video with your favorite protein, you can use this Jupyter notebook to generate your predictions and then view them with ChimeraX:
* [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14E0AR3s_M7m1zAs1iew5TQt0E6QiMvSb?usp=sharing&)
  
Or this other one that uses AlphaFold2 (made by Sergey Ovchinnikov):
* [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabDesign/blob/v1.1.1/af/examples/af_single_sequential.ipynb)

If you do, share your video and we'll put together a protein OF ðŸ˜¬!
