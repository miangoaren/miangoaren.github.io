Today is Friday, protein Friday! And if you want to (relatively) mass download AlphaFold2 models given a list of Uniprot IDs, 
here’s [a tutorial I wrote in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uHt0PJWGOU3O9BC9T4TJbQwEFO32cSNj):

But if you have >2TB of storage (ideally around 10TB), it’s better to download the pre-compressed databases and then 
select the models you're interested in. With [foldcomp](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldcomp), you can compress your 
proteins to save space, similar to a .rar/.zip file. In fact, the authors already provide 
[pre-compressed databases](https://foldcomp.steineggerlab.workers.dev/).

The optimized code with numpy takes about ~28 hours to download 100,000 protein structures, each with around 350 amino acids.
