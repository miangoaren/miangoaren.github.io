Over these years, I've studied this protein known as [TEM-1 ](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1ZG4). It's well known, but equally debated, especially regarding the role of each of the residues directly involved in catalysis. In yellow, there's a glycine, one of the 6 most important amino acids, and in cyan, the rest. All the others do something neat, but the little yellow one does nothing more than not get in the way, because being so small allows the others to do their job.

The main takeaway of this story is: If you don't get in the way, you will help a lot
