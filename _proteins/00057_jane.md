Today I learned that Jane Richardson was the creator of the diagrams of helices, sheets, and turns that we use to 
illustrate proteins. Before her, everything was 
[little balls and sticks that were very difficult to interpret](https://miangoaren.github.io/proteins/00036_viz).

So Jane designed a scientifically accurate and stylish way to represent proteins, inspired by the work of several artists 
like M.C. Escher. This crystallized along with a 
[173-page article published in 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065323308605203?via%3Dihub).

Here’s the full story from 
[Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-colorful-ribbon-diagrams-became-the-face-of-proteins-20240823).

There's even a beautiful book called 
[Introduction to Protein Structure](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Introduction-Protein-Structure-Carl-Branden/dp/0815323050) that 
features all of her hand-drawn protein illustrations!
