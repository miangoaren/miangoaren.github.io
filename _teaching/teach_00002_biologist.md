I created this series of tips to facilitate learning for new students in the biology program at the Faculty of Sciences (UNAM), although i think that they can be generalized to other fields.

When I started my journey as a biologist student, I was unaware of many things, from the different ways to access recreational events to how to download a paper. This series of tips aims to help with this by providing resources that may be useful during the program, something I wish someone had shown me at some point.

I have been working on for several years on this is a project. To give it visibility, I usually use social media as well as posters that I put up in the faculty of Sciences so that students can access them.
