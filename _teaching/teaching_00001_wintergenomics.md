<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ckIbT93Qhjc?feature=share&t=275">In this seminar</a> I had the opportunity to collaborate with WinterGenomics to talk about metagenomics.

In it I introduce the main procedures and tools for reconstructing genomes from metagenomes as well as other aspects related to work within the field of microbial ecology.
