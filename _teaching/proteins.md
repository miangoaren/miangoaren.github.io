I created this <a href="https://github.com/miangoar/AI-driven-protein-design">free 10-lecture course</a> to introduce you to protein design.

## General description

I want more people to learn how to design proteins using Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, I’ve found two problems:
1. there are no comprehensive online courses on the topic  
2. the existing courses are often too expensive for most students in Latin America  

<p>To address these problems, I created this free 10-lecture course as an introduction to AI-driven protein design. The course has two main resources:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@miangoar_bio">The 10 lectures on YouTube</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/miangoar/AI-driven-protein-desig">A GitHub repository</a> containing the following resources:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Tools: recommended libraries organized into +10 categories such as protein sequence and structure processing, data management, machine learning, etc.</li>
      <li>Learning resources: courses and blogs to learn topics such as Python, data science, bioinformatics, etc.</li>
      <li>Databases: recommended sources to download protein data (i.e., sequences, structures, embeddings, (meta)genomes).</li>
      <li>Tutorials: tutorials for learning how to process and analyze protein science data.</li>
      <li>Selected papers: scientific articles I recommend.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>


## Access to the slides

This course is composed of +800 slides, each containing image sources, citations, and recommended resources in the notes section. The slides were created in PowerPoint, so I recommend viewing them using that software. You can download the slides in the following two options:

* [Zenodo]()
* [Google Drive]()

This is intended to give you access to more information so you can explore the topics in greater depth. If you are a teacher and have adopted this material for your lectures, please let me know. I would love to hear how you improved the course and to know that more people are learning about protein science. However, if you identify someone who has fully or partially plagiarized this course AND is charging money to access it, I would appreciate it if you notified me.

## Course organization

![webinar](https://miangoar.github.io/images/teaching/lectures.png)

The theoretical lectures are numbered from 01 to 10 to facilitate understanding of the topics. For example, to discuss AlphaFold, it is necessary to know concepts from structural biology and deep learning. Below is a brief description of the lectures and their topics:
