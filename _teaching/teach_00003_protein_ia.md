Descripción
======

As part of my master's thesis I want to facilitate the access for people interested in learning about protein science based on artificial intelligence. For this purpose, I created the following repository, which contains various resources to introduce to the topic.
* Repository: <https://github.com/miangoar/ciencia-de-proteinas-basada-en-IA>

Content:
1. Seminars: a series of videos on YouTube that I record to introduce to:
   - protein structure, function and evolution
   - useful tools for processing protein sequences and structures with an emphasis on machine learning
   - hardware and software
   - machine learning and deep learning
   - language models
   - biases in protein science based on artificial intelligence

2. Recommended videos: a series of videos on YouTube to introduce to the topics of molecular and protein evolution, as well as AI based protein science based.

3. Tutorials: Jupyter notebooks written by me or others

4. Recommended tools: tools that I personally recommend for conducting analysis of protein sequences and structures.

5. Useful repositories: a series of repositories where you can access to more tools 

6. Webservers: websites that offer bioinformatics analyses of protein science based on artificial intelligence without the need for coding.

7. Learning resources: websites that I recommend with complete courses to learn protein science, data science, and machine learning.

8. Recommended literature: papers that I personally recommend to introduce to the topics of molecular and protein evolution, as well as protein science based on artificial intelligence.
