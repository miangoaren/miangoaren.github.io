<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyLF03w8lRE">In this seminar</a>, I was invited to talk about taxogenomics and metagenomics.

A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to give a talk on the introduction to metagenomics and taxogenomics at ICML/UNAM. If you are not familiar with the topic and find it of interest, you will learn about the current problem that we face with the uncultivated microbes and how we discover them through DNA.

Ps. Many thanks to Mirna Vázquez and Diana Oaxaca for giving me this opportunity to talk about one of the topics that I am most passionate about.
