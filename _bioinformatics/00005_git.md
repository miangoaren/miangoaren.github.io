Sometimes when you're looking for code in a GitHub repository, you can get overwhelmed by so many files/dependencies. To make the matter more visual, Amelia developed this application to visualize a repository hierarchically and organized by directory and file type, and moreover, it allows you to find a script within the repository more easily.

The tool is cool, and I use it occasionally. For example, here's a visualization of the AlphaFold2 repository from DeepMind, where you can see that it's mostly written in Python.

If GitHub (the largest code repository) were a map, these would be its countries üßê

Andrei (a developer) took on the task of relating the most popular GitHub repositories to create this map. It serves to find similar repositories.

In red are the countries "I have visited" since there are programs/libraries that I use (Blast, AlphaFold2, etc.). He did a great job.
