Something people don't tell you is that bioinformatics is:
- 90% reading manuals
- 10% sitting down to write

In fact, here's my Top 3 bioinfo programs with the most difficult documentation I've read:
1. MMSeqs2: <https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki>
2. HHblits: <https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite/wiki>
3. Infernal (on the imagen): <http://eddylab.org/infernal/>

It might be that as you read, the authors send you to the supplementary material for more details. But what you don't realize is that the supplementary material is 100 pages long! üòë

We've reached a point where we need a hero. Thank god Batman is also a [bioinformatician](https://github.com/gjospin/PhyloSift/blob/5d2882c6de54c679ab5ec6a9c3a7041592bd88ff/lib/Phylosift/Utilities.pm#L294)

In bioinformatics, one's life is spent compiling programs like Rosetta... it took ~5h to compile.üòê

Finally. I didn't think this meme was true, but between MSAs and heatmaps, I'm going to have an epileptic attack.
