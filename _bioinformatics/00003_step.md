When I started with bioinformatics about ~4 years ago, I remember being extremely excited to print my first bunch of sequences in the terminal and see the kilos of nucleotides running across the screen. When I've seen other people start their bioinformatics journey, it seems that they are also excited and even share stories on their social networks. It's like when you run your first gel and take photos with the gel electrophoresis camera. A beautiful feeling.
