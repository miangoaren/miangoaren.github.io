Python is an easy-to-learn programming language due to its clear syntax. Furthermore, it has become so popular because it is the most used language in data science and AI, with famous libraries like Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, FastAI, Huggingface-Transformers, or JAX. In fact, Python has been ranked No. 1 for several years in the TIOBE index, which measures the popularity of various languages.

However, something curious about Python is that its fame is due to other languages like C, C++, Rust, and CUDA (which is actually based on C/C++). The most famous libraries in Python are actually highly optimized pieces of code from those other languages, and Python serves as a kind of interface (known as a wrapper). In other words, Python is famous for making things simple.

I still don't understand why R is taught more in biology than Python. Most of us start by loving R, but I think it's more because of how great its ggplot library is for making graphics. Disclaimer, comment from a Pythonista üò¨
